This is a React component for a login page that uses Next.js and NextAuth for authentication. The component renders a page with a title, a favicon, and an image. It also maps through the available providers passed as props and creates a login button for each provider.

The code seems to be fine at a glance. However, if you’re experiencing any issues related to this component, it could be related to the data passed to it as props.

To address this, you can add a conditional rendering to check if the providers prop is not null or undefined. This can help prevent errors when attempting to access properties of an undefined object:

import React from "react";
import Head from "next/head";
import { signIn } from "next-auth/react";

const Login = ({ providers }) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center bg-black min-h-screen w-full justify-center">
      <Head>
        <title>Spotify Clone</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" />
        <link
          rel="icon"
          href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.fe4bfd3bd082e4fd4d6aca3f255925b1?rik=Hwa9QxFb3%2bIjtw&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"
        />
      </Head>
      <img
        className="w-52 mb-5"
        src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.fe4bfd3bd082e4fd4d6aca3f255925b1?rik=Hwa9QxFb3%2bIjtw&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"
        alt="images"
      />
      {providers &&
        Object.values(providers).map((provider) => (
          <div key={provider.name}>
            <button
              className="bg-[#18D860] text-white p-5 rounded-lg"
              onClick={() => signIn(provider.id, { callbackUrl: "/" })}
            >
              Login with {provider.name}
            </button>
          </div>
        ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Login;


Adding providers && before Object.values(providers).map() ensures that the mapping will only be executed if providers is not null or undefined.
